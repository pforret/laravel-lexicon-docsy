## Definition

> Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework. &bull; [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)


## Usage

A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.

Having a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality.

For instance, an app that uploads short funny videos with cats to social media could potentially use a professional video conversion library. However, all that it really needs is a class with the single method encode(filename, format). After creating such a class and connecting it with the video conversion library, youâ€™ll have your first facade.
