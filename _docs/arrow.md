## Definition

> Arrow functions were introduced in PHP 7.4 as a more concise syntax for [anonymous functions](/anonymous-function) &bull; [php.net](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arrow.php)

## Usage

> Besides the obvious advantage of being shorter and more readable than classic anonymous functions, arrow functions can access variables from the parent scope through a technique called "_implicit by-value scope binding_" &bull; [codepunker.com](https://www.codepunker.com/blog/basic-usage-of-closures-in-php)

## Examples
    $posts = [/* â€¦ */];
    
    // classic closure 
    $ids = array_map(function ($post) {
            return $post->id;
        }, $posts);
    
    // short closure/arrow function
    $ids = array_map(fn($post) => $post->id, $posts);
